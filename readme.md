## Introduction

There has been growing public and corporate interest of social networking sites over the last few years. Social media analysis can be developed for many applications, such as health care, finance, voting intentions, security and defense, disaster response, NLP-based modeling, NLP-based social media visualization, entertainment, and media monitoring [1]. Studies in social media have been developed on various modalities such as text [2] [3] [4], image [5], video [6], and network graph [7]. Sentiment analysis and affective computing have become one of the main areas of research in social media [8]. Sentiment analysis includes an analysis of the positive or negative tendency of a user towards a product, brand, or company, and an analysis of social roles, popularity, or values in social networks. Sentiment analysis classifies user opinions into two binary polarities, which are positive and negative. However, Twitter posts also contain emotionless posts which needs to be classified as neutral. Other analyzes of sentiment are classified into numeric rating [9]. Furthermore, given that Twitter posts contain an average of 33 characters [10], it is challenging to acquire a finer granularity such as obtaining a numeric rating. The most common method used is supervised learning with different types of features.

Unstructured Big Data content is rapidly growing in social media [11]. Previously text-based, nowadays, social media posts contain images and videos. Aside from text, users may also post images to share their life experiences as well as their opinions. Since Twitter recommended users to post images for better social media engagement \cite{Rogers2014}, users have actively posted images to accompany text-based posts. In 2012, there are 400 million tweets per day, which are 36\% of users posted images, which is the largest type of multimedia shared \cite{Laird2012}, and image posted is more likely to be retweeted \cite{Roberts2019}. 

A user on social media can post photos of themselves celebrating New Year and caption it with their comment regarding their feeling about the celebration. The text, as well as facial expressions, may indicate their emotion during the celebration \cite{you2016cross}. Therefore, image and text should be viewed together since these two domains complement each other \cite{you2016robust}. Users also express their sentiment in social media posts through emoticons and videos. Sometimes the processing of text alone is not enough due to the ambiguity of the sentence. Thus the use of images can help analyze sentiment. Figure \ref{fig:contoh} gives an example of two posts where image and text are clarified by each other. The top image shows three ladies with various expressions in which the text in English means \textquotesingle the script creator did not think hence causing army name bad in elf eyes\textquotesingle. Therefore, we can conclude that it is a negative post. The second image also shows football activities, which is accompanied by text that expresses negativity \textquotesingle This tactical analysis shows how France killed Argentina\textquotesingle s high line structure \textquotesingle.

Twitter is a popular social media in Indonesia, and in 2017 Indonesia is in the top five Twitter users in the world \cite{Herman2017}. In the same year, more than 143 million Indonesians use the internet, and approximately 90 percent of these people are Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram users. Hence, Tweets are compact and reliable data for sentiment analysis in Indonesian \cite{budiharto2018prediction}. Not only events and news, but also emotional expressions are shown in social media posts. This gives researchers an opportunity to analyze the behavior of users in Indonesia. Industry and event organizers also need to analyze public opinion. As a result, a variety of studies are carried out on predictive sentiment analysis.

Social Media Analysis in Indonesian and English languages face similar challenges, though there are differences in their grammatical structure. By machine learning, approach in English Sentiment Analysis could also be applied for Indonesian, such as the use of external knowledge \cite{le2016sentiment}. The need for external knowledge is due to Indonesian as a low resource language. We also need to address concerns in Indonesian social media posts such as informal language \cite{le2016sentiment}, mixed language, slang words, inappropriate abbreviations, and sarcasm. Classical machine learning methods in Sentiment Analysis require the extraction of hand-crafted features. However, Deep Learning approaches perform end-to-end feature representation and classification together \cite{minaee2020deep}. There are also still opportunities to develop Indonesian Image-Text Sentiment Analysis. 

In addition to analyzing text-based user posts, image and social networks need to be analyzed in a comprehensive study to understand sentiments of social media users. Text and images are posted together, more than other modalities, so we use text and images in this study. Several researchers have presented sentiment analysis based on image-text multiview features\cite{soleymani2017survey}. \cite{chen2015velda} shown in their paper that image and text in social media have a correlation and complemented each other, and display emotional relevance.  Moreover, studies in Indonesian Sentiment Analysis that combine features from image and text are rarely seen. In conjunction with the image, text in social media posts could express the user\textquotesingle s feelings \cite{vempala2019categorizing}.

On the other hand, Image Classification usually detects objects from an image, such as an image of the sky or a dog. However, Image Sentiment Analysis should extract adjectives correlated with images together with nouns for obtaining sentiment strength. Thus, concept which is defined as Adjective Noun Pairs could provide semantic representation for obtaining better sentiment from an image. A pre-trained model called DeepSentiBank \cite{chen2014deepsentibank} is used in our research, representing the concept features. Resources in Indonesian languages for obtaining concepts from images is limited. Therefore, we proposed an approach that could be adopted in Indonesian Sentiment Analysis with English based DeepSentiBank.

Unlike conventional text sentiment analysis that uses bag of words with a co-occurence count, we need to analyze words based on commonsense concepts. Implicit expressions need to be analyzed in relation to concepts. Therefore, we use external knowledge to enhance text sentiment analysis with SenticNet 5. \cite{cambria2018senticnet} We use a localized version of SenticNet, which was developed especially for the English Sentiment Analysis. \cite{xia2014localization}.
 
The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 
\begin{enumerate} \item A novel framework for detecting sentiment from microblog posts by fusion of text, image, and concept features. Text posts were classified with Convolutional Neural Networks. Concepts from the text are extracted with a concept ontology, which is SenticNet 5. Moreover, concept was extracted from images with DeepSentiBank pre-trained model, which is a model based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. \item Combining classifier results with Stacking Based Ensemble Learning to balance each model\textquotesingle s performance with a Meta-Classifier. Ensemble Learning is believed to yield better performance since there is a diversity between models for Image, Text, and Concept Fusion. \cite{rokach2010ensemble} \item We also created an Indonesian dataset for Image-Text Sentiment Analysis from Social Media. \item To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform multiview sentiment analysis, which includes a fusion of image, text, and concept in Indonesian. We believe our ensemble model of Image-Text-Concept Fusion would advance the research of Sentiment Analysis, especially in Indonesian.
\end{enumerate}

The subsequent section reviews the related works of Image-Text Sentiment Analysis. Then, the Ensemble Learning of image-text-concept fusion Sentiment Analysis Framework is presented in Section III. Section IV provides a description of the Image-Text dataset for Indonesian Sentiment Analysis. The results of experiments with analysis are reported in Section V. Finally, the last section describes the conclusion and future works.
